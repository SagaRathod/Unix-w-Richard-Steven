Programs_in_Advanced_programming_in_UNIX_Environment_by_W_Richard_Stevens

** This book is divided into six parts:

1) An overview and introduction to basic Unix programming concepts and terminology (Chapter 1),with a discussion of the various Unix standardization efforts and different Unix implementations(Chapter 2).

2) I/O -> Unbuffered I/O (Chapter 3), properties of files and directories (Chapter 4), the standard I/O library (Chapter 5), and the standard system data files (Chapter 6).

3) Processes -> The environment of a Unix process (Chapter 7), process control (Chapter 8), the relationships between different processes (Chapter 9), and signals (Chapter 10).

4) More I/O -> Terminal I/O (Chapter 11), advanced I/O (Chapter 12), and daemon processes(Chapter 13).

5) IPC -> Interprocess communication (Chapters 14 and 15).

6) Examples -> A database library (Chapter 16), communicating with a PostScript printer (Chapter17), a modem dialing program (Chapter 18), and using pseudo terminals (Chapter 19).

** Note :-  All the examples are in the C programming language. Furthermore, these examples are in ANSI C.

** Most of the examples in this text have been run on four different versions of Unix:

1. Unix System V/386 Release 4.0 Version 2.0 ("vanilla SVR4") from U.H. Corp. (UHC), on an Intel
80386 processor.

2. 4.3+BSD at the Computer Systems Research Group, Computer Science Division, University of
California at Berkeley, on a Hewlett Packard workstation.

3. BSD/386 (a derivative of the BSD Net 2 release) from Berkeley Software Design, Inc., on an
Intel 80386 processor. This system is almost identical to what we call 4.3+BSD.

4. SunOS 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 (systems with a strong Berkeley heritage but many System V features)
from Sun Microsystems, on a SPARCstation SLC.
